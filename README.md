# 🌍 Public Collaborative Game Project

Welcome to the **Public Game** — an open, community-driven project where *anyone* can contribute.
All edits, ideas, and improvements are welcome. I’ll merge everything!

Whether you're into game design, art, lore, mechanics, engine work, or experimental features, feel free to jump in.
**It doesn’t need to be beginner-friendly — anything from simple tweaks to highly advanced systems is completely fine.**

If you’d like to coordinate or discuss ideas directly, contact me at:
📧 **[pangpeter876@gmail.com](mailto:pangpeter876@gmail.com)**

Let’s build something awesome together.
